# chip8
A chip8 emulator coded in C++ using SFML 2.5.1.

The functionality of the core emulator is there. It will run Chip8 games and control them. There is no sound, and once a game is over, you must restart the program. There is no SCHIP8 functionality as of yet. These are planned for the future.

To load a rom, either drag and drop a rom file onto the exe, or open run the "Chip8 Emulator.exe" file and provide the program with
a absolute pathfile: "C:\Roms\INVADERS.c8". The extension of the file does not matter.

You control the program using the keys below:

'1234
 qwer
 asdf'

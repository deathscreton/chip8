# chip8
A chip8 emulator coded in C++ using SFML 2.5.1.

The functionality of the core emulator is there. It will run Chip8 games and control them, and make a beep noise when appropriate. TThere is no SCHIP8 functionality as of yet. This are planned for the future.

To load a rom, either drag and drop a rom file onto the exe, or open run the "Chip8 Emulator.exe" file and provide the program with
a absolute pathfile: "C:\Roms\INVADERS.c8". The extension of the file does not matter.

You control the program using the keys below:

'1234
 qwer
 asdf'
 
 F1 soft restarts the game, allowing you to restart the game from the beginning. F2 hard resets the program, allowing you to choose a new ROM. ESC is used to quit during play. 

You can ignote the VS19 solution files if you use a different IDE.
